# Blinkit-Sales-Analysis-Python-EDA-Project-

--> Project Overview
This project focuses on performing an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Blinkit’s sales data using Python to understand sales performance, customer behavior, and outlet characteristics.
The goal is to extract actionable insights aligned with business KPIs through data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations

--> Business Requirement
To conduct a comprehensive analysis of Blinkit's sales performance, customer satisfaction, and inventory distribution in order to identify key insights and opportunities for optimization using various KPIs and visualizations.


--> Key KPIs Analyzed
The following KPIs were derived and analyzed as part of the project:

**Total Sales: Overall revenue generated from all items sold.
**Average Sales: Average revenue per salee
**Number of Items: Total count of items sold across outlets.
**Average Rating: Average customer rating for items sold.


--> Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process included:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Handling inconsistent categories (e.g., item fat content)
Aggregation and grouping analysis
Trend analysis over years
Category-wise and outlet-wise sales analysis


-->Visualizations

The following visual insights were created using Matplotlib & Seaborn:
Sales distribution by Item Fat Content
Total sales by Item Type
Sales trend by Outlet Establishment Year
Sales by Outlet Size
Sales by Outlet Location Type
Comparison of categorical variables using bar and pie charts


-->Tools & Technologies Used
Python
Pandas – Data manipulation & aggregation
NumPy – Numerical operations
Matplotlib – Data visualization
Seaborn – Statistical visualizations
Jupyter Notebook
